# Knights-Tour-C++

Solves the knight's tour problem for boards size 5-8.
To run: type "make main" from terminal and then "./main" once it compiles. Input the size you want for your board and then your starting position on the board.
The board will will then print the result, if it's achievable.
Warning: not all starting positions work on all boards, and if the board gets too big it will take a while to solve (increasing the board size adds a lot of recursive steps)

Try tracing the solutions on paper for some interesting designs!
